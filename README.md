*Your model gets the right answer. But does it actually **reason**?*

</div>

## The Problem: Right Answers, Wrong Reasons

Current vision-language benchmarks only check final answers. This means a model that **guesses correctly** scores the same as one that **reasons correctly**. CRYSTAL exposes this blind spot.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/teaser_sample0.jpg" width="280"/>

> **Q:** *"Which of the 3 objects is the smallest?"* &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; A model answers correctly (C: middle console), but its reasoning states the middle console is *larger* than the others while claiming it's the smallest. **Traditional benchmarks give full credit for this lucky guess.** CRYSTAL catches it (Match F1: 0.15).
</div>

## What is CRYSTAL?

**C**lear **R**easoning via **Y**ielded **S**teps, **T**raceability and **L**ogic &mdash; a diagnostic benchmark with **6,372 instances** that evaluates multimodal reasoning through **verifiable intermediate steps**.

Instead of just asking *"is the answer correct?"*, CRYSTAL asks:
- Did the model identify the right visual elements?
- Did it apply the correct logical steps?
- Are the steps in a coherent order?

### How It Works

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/reasoning_flowchart.png" width="700"/>

*Multi-agent reasoning pipeline. Four independent MLLMs generate candidate steps, semantically clustered into consensus sequences, validated by a 5th agent, and verified by human annotators.*
</div>

### Benchmark Statistics

| Step range | 3 &ndash; 42 |
| Difficulty split | Easy 48.5% / Medium 44.1% / Hard 7.4% |
| Sources | MathVision, ScienceQA, RealWorldQA, MMVP, PlotQA |

### Novel Metrics

</div>

**Question:** *"How many eggs can you place so no two eggs are in the same row or column?"*

**Baseline model (Qwen2.5-VL-3B):**
> *"The answer is 3."* &mdash; Correct answer, but states the goal without explaining *how*.

**After CPR-Curriculum training:**
> *"Step 1: The grid is 2 rows x 3 columns. Step 2: Apply checkerboard placement constraint. Step 3: Place eggs at positions (1,1), (2,2) avoiding shared rows/columns. Step 4: Maximum is 2 per constraint... but wait, with 2 rows we can place at most 2. Re-examine: 3 columns allow diagonal placement. Answer: 3."* &mdash; Structured reasoning with explicit strategy.

## Key Findings

We evaluated **20 MLLMs** (16 open-source from 1B to 38B, plus GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5.2 Instant, and Gemini 2.5 Flash):

### Finding 1: Cherry-Picking is Universal

**19 out of 20 models** produce high-precision but low-recall reasoning &mdash; they say a few correct things but skip most of the required steps.

| Model | Params | Accuracy | Match F1 | Precision | Recall |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| | | ***Commercial*** | | | |
| GPT-5 | n/a | **57.99%** | 0.612 | 0.925 | 0.479 |
| GPT-5-mini | n/a | 55.59% | **0.773** | **0.978** | 0.669 |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | n/a | 53.95% | 0.673 | 0.701 | **0.765** |
| GPT-5.2 Instant | n/a | 47.35% | 0.564 | 0.974 | 0.416 |
| | | ***Qwen Family*** | | | |
| Qwen3-VL-8B | 8B | **57.66%** | 0.659 | 0.827 | 0.590 |
| Qwen3-VL-32B | 32B | 49.22% | 0.718 | 0.819 | 0.704 |
| Qwen2.5-VL-32B | 32B | 47.63% | 0.653 | 0.943 | 0.524 |
| Qwen2.5-VL-3B | 3B | 39.85% | 0.480 | 0.898 | 0.347 |
| Qwen3-VL-2B | 2B | 34.15% | 0.595 | 0.726 | 0.535 |
| Qwen2.5-VL-7B | 7B | 30.43% | 0.475 | 0.765 | 0.365 |
| | | ***InternVL Family*** | | | |
| InternVL3.5-8B | 8B | 51.98% | 0.530 | 0.882 | 0.416 |
| InternVL3.5-38B | 38B | 51.21% | 0.612 | 0.892 | 0.498 |
| InternVL3.5-4B | 4B | 37.61% | 0.432 | 0.895 | 0.325 |
| InternVL3.5-2B | 2B | 33.02% | 0.469 | 0.725 | 0.371 |
| InternVL3.5-1B | 1B | 30.13% | 0.330 | 0.616 | 0.243 |
| | | ***Other Open-Source*** | | | |
| Gemma3-12B | 12B | 33.83% | 0.605 | 0.838 | 0.499 |
| Gemma3-4B | 4B | 28.65% | 0.618 | 0.878 | 0.506 |
| Llama 3.2-11B | 11B | 24.83% | 0.471 | 0.713 | 0.379 |
| LLaVA-v1.6-7B | 7B | 24.66% | 0.512 | 0.961 | 0.370 |
| MiniCPM-v2.6-8B | 8B | 25.54% | 0.215 | 0.709 | 0.134 |

> Even GPT-5 (best accuracy: 57.99%) recovers only **47.9% of reference steps**. Models say the right things but omit most of the reasoning.

### Finding 2: Accuracy and Reasoning Diverge

GPT-5 leads accuracy but ranks **8th** in Match F1. GPT-5-mini leads F1 at lower accuracy. **Gemma3-4B outperforms InternVL3.5-38B** in reasoning despite 9.5x fewer parameters.

### Finding 3: No Model Reasons in Order

Among competitive models, **no model preserves more than 60% of matched steps in the correct order**. Models retrieve relevant reasoning steps but fail to organize them coherently.

### Finding 4: Scaling is Non-Monotonic

Bigger models don't uniformly improve: Qwen3-VL-32B achieves better F1 (0.718) but *lower accuracy* (49.22%) than Qwen3-VL-8B (0.659 F1, 57.66% accuracy). Scale can improve answer extraction while suppressing reasoning coverage.


## Training with Causal Process Reward

CRYSTAL isn't just a benchmark &mdash; it enables a new training paradigm. We propose **Causal Process Reward (CPR)**, a multiplicative reward that couples answer correctness with step-level alignment:

$$R_{\text{CPR}} = \begin{cases} a_w + s_w \cdot \text{F1}_{\text{step}} & \text{if answer correct} \\ s_w \cdot \text{F1}_{\text{step}} \cdot \lambda & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

Unlike additive rewards (which let models maximize accuracy by guessing while ignoring reasoning), CPR requires both correct answers **and** faithful reasoning.

### CPR-Curriculum: +32% Match F1 where others fail

| Strategy | Accuracy | Match F1 | Precision | Recall | Ordered F1 |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Baseline (Qwen2.5-VL-3B) | 39.85% | 0.480 | 0.898 | 0.347 | 0.434 |
| Composite (additive) | 44.92% | 0.426 | 0.983 | 0.284 | 0.392 |
| Answer-Only | 44.30% | 0.429 | 0.803 | 0.308 | 0.380 |
| **CPR** | 41.40% | **0.633** | 0.975 | 0.489 | **0.560** |
| **CPR-Curriculum** | **47.52%** | **0.633** | 0.963 | **0.493** | **0.560** |

> Additive strategies collapse at step 600 and diverge to NaN by step 1,500. CPR trains stably through 2,800 steps.

*Left: Match F1 trajectory. Right: Accuracy trajectory. Composite collapses at step 600; CPR variants train stably through 2,800 steps.*
</div>

### Cross-Model Generalization: CPR-Curriculum on InternVL3.5-4B

Same two-phase protocol, no architecture-specific tuning. Recall nearly **triples** (0.325 &rarr; 0.811):

| Configuration | Accuracy | Match F1 | Precision | Recall | Ordered F1 |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Baseline (InternVL3.5-4B) | 37.61% | 0.432 | 0.895 | 0.325 | 0.387 |
| **CPR-Curriculum** | **45.76%** | **0.833** | **0.903** | **0.811** | **0.719** |
| &Delta; | +8.15 | +0.401 | +0.008 | +0.486 | +0.332 |

> CPR-Curriculum generalizes across architectures: **+93% Match F1** on InternVL3.5-4B without any model-specific tuning.

## Ablation Studies

### Encoder and Threshold Selection

We tested 4 sentence encoders across 5 thresholds (100 experiments). DistilRoBERTa-v1 dominates with 4-8pp advantages across all model families. Model rankings remain stable across all configurations.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/ablation_encoders.png" width="700"/>

*Encoder comparison across thresholds. DistilRoBERTa-v1 consistently outperforms alternatives. Threshold variation yields only 2-3pp swings.*
</div>

### Human Agreement Study

On 100 adversarially sampled step pairs, the encoder achieves **84% agreement** with a human annotator, with **100% agreement below the threshold** (zero false matches on semantically unrelated steps).

| Similarity Band | Pairs | Agreement | Note |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--|
| < 0.20 | 33 | 100.0% | No false matches |
| [0.20, 0.35) | 14 | 100.0% | No false matches |
| [0.35, 0.50) | 19 | 68.4% | Borderline zone |
| [0.50, 0.70) | 25 | 64.0% | Borderline zone |
| >= 0.70 | 9 | 88.9% | Clear matches |
| **Overall** | **100** | **84.0%** | Cohen's kappa = 0.534 |

**Q:** *"What color is the traffic light?"* &nbsp; **GT:** Green
